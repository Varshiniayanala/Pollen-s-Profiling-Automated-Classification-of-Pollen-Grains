# Pollen-s-Profiling-Automated-Classification-of-Pollen-Grains
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify pollen grain images from the Brazilian Savannah. It aims to support ecological research by providing an efficient, AI-based method for pollen identification. Includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optional Flask-based deployment.
